# Nick's Ray Tracing in One Weekend
A ray tracer written in C following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) 
book series. Below are output images as my work on the ray tracer progresses.

This final image took an embarassing 20 hours and 13 minutes to render. In this
scene I used a higher pixel sample rate and included more objects. Also the ray
tracer is just not very optimized, so it takes a very long time.
