# Nick's Ray Tracing in One Weekend
A ray tracer written in C following the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) 
book series. I made this to help me learn a bunch of things: C, Makefiles, git, 
raytracing, and getting more comfortable on the command line. 

## Below are output images as my work on the ray tracer progresses.
